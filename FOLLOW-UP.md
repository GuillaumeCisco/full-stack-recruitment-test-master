---

# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
5 hours

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Better svg and css.
Put defaultProps, propTypes.
Put my own webpack bootstrap architecture with SSR, PRPL pattern, better HMR, Service Worker Precache, redux. But I thought it would be a bit overkill for this simple exercise.
I would have also liked using emotion, and redux-first-router.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
Everything

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
css, because devil is hidden in the details.
I had some difficulties understanding the API, looks like a lot of duplication in the data.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
Easy Peasy.
Explain links between data.
